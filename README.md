## Development

Clone the project, and open the `index.html` file in your browser of choice.

`npm i`

To install all the required packages for local development

`gulp watch`

To watch the scss files in the `.scss/` directory and compile them to the `.css/` directory whenever changes are made.

Alternatively you can use `gulp buildStyles` to build them on request.

## Animation Enhancements

I have added animations to the project and improved the file structure of the scss files using partials. 

This code on a branch called `animated`.
